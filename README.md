# Parse the Parcel #
This is a coding exercise for one of the companies.

## Requirements ##
Our new service shipping costs are based on size and we offer different prices for small, medium, and large boxes. Unfortunately we're currently unable to move heavy packages so we've placed an upper limit of 25kg per package.

| Package Type | Length | Breadth | Height | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 200mm | 300mm | 150mm | $5.00 |
| Medium | 300mm | 400mm | 200mm| $7.50 |
| Large | 400mm | 600mm | 250mm | $8.50 |

## Coding Exercise ##

We need you to implement a component that, when supplied the dimensions (length x breadth x height) and weight of a package, can advise on the cost and type of package required. If the package exceeds these dimensions - or is over 25kg - then the service should not return a packaging solution.
